## Motivation of the project
There are a lot of factors which influence our performance in exams. Is gender one of them? Is it worth to pay for the preparation course? I wanted to answear this questions.

## Summary of the results
I examined the participation in an exam preparation course and found out that the dataset doesn't have the proper variables to tell this correctly.
Then I looked at the difference in performance between male and female students. Generally, females have higher scores in reading and writing, but males perform better in math. But are these differences significant? For this I used hypothesis testing to find out. The result depended on the weightening of the subjects' scores.
